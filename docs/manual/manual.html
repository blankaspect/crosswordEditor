        CrosswordEditor is a Java application for creating, editing and solving crosswords.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section1-1">1.1&nbsp; Features</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor has the following features:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          You can create and edit a crossword grid that has either <a
          href="#def-block">blocks</a> or <a href="#def-bar">bars</a> as separators.  The grid
          may have one of several kinds of rotational or reflectional symmetry.  The grid must
          be rectangular, and only horizontal (<i>across</i>) and vertical (<i>down</i>) <a
          href="#def-field">fields</a> are supported.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          You can write and edit clues for the fields in the grid.  A clue may encompass more
          than one field, and a single field may have more than one clue.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          A crossword may have a title as well as multiple paragraphs of styled text before the
          grid and after the clues.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          You can enter your answers to clues in the grid.  You can complete a crossword over
          several sessions by saving and loading the crossword document between sessions.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          A solution to a crossword may be included with the crossword document or it may be
          loaded from a remote location.  A solution may be encrypted, allowing the publication
          of competitions in which the solution is made accessible by publishing its password
          after the closing date.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          A crossword can be imported from an external source (eg, a web page or a PDF file) by
          &apos;capturing&apos; its grid and clues.  A grid is captured by selecting its region
          in an image (eg, a screenshot).  The detection of the grid within the image can be
          automatic.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          A crossword can be exported as an HTML page, allowing it to be printed from a web
          browser.  To conserve printer ink or toner, the blocks of a blocked grid in an
          exported HTML file may consist of diagonal lines of a specified density instead of a
          square of solid colour.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="wrap">
        A glossary of some of the terms used in CrosswordEditor and in this manual can be found
        in an <a href="#sectionA">appendix</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section1-2">1.2&nbsp; Licence</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor is made available under two licences:

    <div class="section">
      <h2 id="section2">2&nbsp; Building and running the application</h2>
      <p class="tocLink">
        [ <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> ]
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        This section assumes that you have some experience of building and running a Java
        application.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section2-1">2.1&nbsp; Building the application</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        A Java Development Kit (JDK) that supports Java 17, such as <a class="external"
        href="https://adoptium.net/">Eclipse Temurin from Adoptium</a>, is required to build
        CrosswordEditor.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <code>src</code> directory of the repository contains all the source code and
        resources that constitute the application; there are no external dependencies.  The
        directory conforms to the Maven standard directory layout: the source code is in
        <code>src/main/java</code> and the resources are in <code>src/main/resources</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The supplied Kotlin-DSL-based <a class="external" href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>
        build script, <code>build.gradle.kts</code>, modifies the <code>compileJava</code> and
        <code>jar</code> tasks (provided by the <code>java</code> plug-in) to compile the
        application and to create an executable JAR file for it.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section2-2">2.2&nbsp; Running the application</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The supplied Kotlin-DSL-based Gradle build script, <code>build.gradle.kts</code>,
        defines two tasks that may be used to run CrosswordEditor:
      </p>
      <dl class="basic">
        <dt>runMain</dt>
        <dd class="wrap">
          Runs the main class from the class files that were generated by the
          <code>compileJava</code> task.
        </dd>
        <dt>runJar</dt>
        <dd class="wrap">
          Runs the executable JAR that was generated by the <code>jar</code> task.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p class="wrap">
        Both tasks extend the <code>JavaExec</code> task.
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        To prevent a new instance of the application from being run each time a file that is <a
        href="#section2-3">associated with CrosswordEditor</a> is opened from, for example, a
        file browser, only one instance of CrosswordEditor may be run at any one time.  When
        CrosswordEditor starts up, it checks whether another instance of the program is running;
        if it finds one, it terminates after informing the the other instance of any files that
        should be opened.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section2-3">2.3&nbsp; Associating file types with CrosswordEditor</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor may be run indirectly by associating file types with its JAR file and
        opening a file of one of those types.  A file association can be created on Windows with
        the <a class="command" href="#section8-6-2">Options &gt; Manage file association</a>
        command.  You can use the same command to remove the file association when you no longer
        want it.
      </p>

    <!-- Configuration -->

    <div class="section">
      <h2 id="section3">3&nbsp; Configuration</h2>
      <p class="tocLink">
        [ <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> ]
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        When it starts up, CrosswordEditor is configured with <i>configuration properties</i>
        that are read from two sources: the <a href="#section3-1">command line</a> of the Java
        launcher and a <a href="#section3-2">configuration file</a> whose location may be
        explicitly specified.  If the same property is specified on the command line and in a
        configuration file, the value from the configuration file takes precedence.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The recommended method of setting the properties in a configuration file is with the <a
        class="command" href="#section8-6-3">Options &gt; Preferences</a> command.  For
        command-line properties, which must be edited manually, the form of the property values
        is given in an <a href="#sectionC">appendix</a>, and it can also be inferred by
        generating a configuration file with the desired values and inspecting the contents of
        the file.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section3-1">3.1&nbsp; Command-line properties</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        When CrosswordEditor is run, configuration properties may be passed to the
        <code>java</code> launcher on the command line as system properties; eg,
        <code>-Dapp.general.mainWindowLocation=&quot;100, 0&quot;</code>.
        CrosswordEditor&apos;s command-line configuration properties all have the prefix
        <code>app.</code> . A list of all the properties that are recognised by CrosswordEditor
        is given in an <a href="#sectionC">appendix</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        System properties can be added to the <a href="#section2-2">two supplied Gradle
        tasks</a>, <code>runMain</code> and <code>runJar</code>, with the
        <code>systemProperties(Map&lt;String, ?&gt;)</code> method.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        One particular property, <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span>, is used to
        specify the directory that contains a configuration file, as <a
        href="#section3-2-1">described below</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section3-2">3.2&nbsp; Configuration file</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The configuration file is named <code>crosswordEditor-config.xml</code>.
        CrosswordEditor doesn&apos;t require a configuration file: it uses a default value for
        any configuration property that is missing from the source(s) of configuration.
        Similarly, if it finds a property value to be invalid, CrosswordEditor will display a
        message to this effect and use the default value of the property.  If the configuration
        file contains a property that was specified on the command line, the value from the
        configuration file is used.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If the configuration has changed when you exit the application normally (ie, using the
        <a class="command" href="#section8-1-9">File &gt; Exit</a> command or an equivalent),
        CrosswordEditor will save its configuration to a configuration file.  If a configuration
        file was read on startup, it will overwrite that file; otherwise, it will write a
        configuration file to the default directory described above, unless the value of the
        <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property was an empty string.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A configuration file can be written explicitly with the <span class="command">Save
        configuration</span> command within the <span class="component">Preferences</span>
        dialog.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section3-2-1">3.2.1&nbsp; Location of the configuration file</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        When it starts up, CrosswordEditor is informed of the location of the configuration file
        with the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property.  The value of the
        property may contain <a href="#sectionB">special constructs</a> for system properties,
        environment variables and the user&apos;s home directory.
      </p>
      <p class="noBottomMargin wrap">
        The <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property may be set in two ways:
      </p>
      <ul class="continuationList">
        <li class="wrap">
          on the command line that runs the <code>java</code> launcher, or
        </li>
        <li class="wrap">
          in a file named <code>crosswordEditor-properties.xml</code> that resides in the same
          directory as the <code>crosswordEditor.jar</code> JAR file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <code>crosswordEditor-properties.xml</code> file is a legacy from the time when
        CrosswordEditor was distributed as a JAR file with an installer; the properties file was
        written by the installer.  If you create a properties file, it should have the following
        form, with the example pathname replaced by the actual pathname:
      </p>
      <pre class="codeFragment">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM &quot;http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;properties&gt;
&lt;entry key=&quot;app.configDir&quot;&gt;/home/slothrop/.blankaspect/crosswordEditor&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</pre>

      <p class="wrap">
        If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property is set both on the
        command line and in the properties file, the value in the properties file takes
        precedence.
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        The existence and value of the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span>
        property determines the locations that are searched for a configuration file:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property exists and the
          property value is an empty string, CrosswordEditor will start without a configuration
          file.  No configuration file will be written when the application exits.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property exists and the
          property value is not empty, CrosswordEditor will look for a configuration file in the
          directory specified by the property.  An error message is displayed if a configuration
          file is not found in the specified directory.
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div class="wrap">
            If the <span class="configProperty">app.configDir</span> property does not exist,
            CrosswordEditor will look for a configuration file at two other locations:
          </div>
          <ol class="list">
            <li class="spaced">
              <div><i>The current working directory</i></div>

                The current working directory, which is denoted by the environment variable
                <code>$PWD</code> on Linux/UNIX systems, depends on the system and the way in
                which CrosswordEditor was run.

              <div class="wrap">
                On Linux/UNIX systems, the default directory is
                <code>$HOME/.blankaspect/crosswordEditor</code>, where <code>$HOME</code> is the
                environment variable that denotes the user&apos;s home directory.  On Windows
                systems, the default directory is
                <code>%APPDATA%\blankaspect\crosswordEditor</code>, where <code>%APPDATA%</code>
                is an environment variable.

      <h3 id="section4-1">4.1&nbsp; Grid</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        All crossword documents have a grid.  CrosswordEditor supports only rectangular,
        orthogonal grids: two-dimensional arrays of cells, with <a href="#def-field">fields</a>
        of contiguous cells that run <i>across</i> the rows of the grid from left to right and
        <i>down</i> its columns from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The parameters of the grid &mdash; separator, size and symmetry &mdash; are specified
        when you create a document with the <a class="command" href="#section8-1-1">File &gt;
        New document</a> command.  After the document is created, the separator and size of the
        grid are fixed, but the symmetry can be changed by <a href="#section8-2-4">editing the
        grid</a>.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-1">4.1.1&nbsp; Separator</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        If a row or column of a grid contains more than one <a href="#def-field">field</a>, the
        fields in the row or column are separated from one another by <i>separators</i>.
        CrosswordEditor supports two kinds of separator: blocks and bars.  A <i>block</i>
        occupies the cell of a grid; a <i>bar</i> divides two contiguous cells along their
        common border.  A grid may have only one kind of separator.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-2">4.1.2&nbsp; Size</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A grid can have between 2 and 99 rows and columns.  The number of rows and the number of
        columns are independent of one another.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-1-3">4.1.3&nbsp; Symmetry</h4>

        The separators of a grid are often arranged symmetrically, presumably for aesthetic
        reasons or because it is customary to do so.  (In the UK, crossword grids commonly have
        2-fold or 4-fold rotational symmetry.)  In CrosswordEditor, a grid may have no symmetry
        or one of the kinds of rotational or reflectional symmetry listed below:

      <h3 id="section4-2">4.2&nbsp; Clues</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The clues of a crossword document are associated with <a href="#def-field">fields</a> of
        the grid; each clue must have at least one <a href="#def-fieldId">field ID</a> &mdash; a
        field number and direction.  (CrosswordEditor does not currently support crosswords that
        have a list of unnumbered and directionless clues for which the solver is required to
        discover the field number and direction.)
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-3">4.3&nbsp; Indications</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        A crossword document may have three indications: a clue-reference keyword, an
        answer-length pattern and substitutions, and a line-break sequence.  A document&apos;s
        indications can be editied with the <a class="command" href="#section8-2-6">Edit &gt;
        Edit indications</a> command.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-3-1">4.3.1&nbsp; Clue-reference keyword</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>clue-reference keyword</i> is a specific word, phrase or symbol in the text of a
        clue that indicates that the clue contains a reference to another clue instead of a
        definition.  The clue containing the reference is associated with a <a
        href="#def-secondaryField">secondary field</a> of a <a
        href="#def-multiFieldClue">multiple-field clue</a> that contains a definition.  In the
        UK, the clue-reference keyword is usually the word &quot;See&quot;, which is the default
        for CrosswordEditor.  For example, if the clue for 5 across were
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        <span class="clue"><b>5, 23</b>&nbsp; A Malaysian city (5,6)</span> ,
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        the clue for 23 across would be the reference
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        <span class="clue"><b>23</b>&nbsp; See 5a</span>
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        in which the word &quot;See&quot; is the clue-reference keyword.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A clue-reference keyword is stored with a document only if the lists of clues contain at
        least one reference.  Conversely, if you open a document that contains no clue
        references, it will have no clue-reference keyword, so you will need to specify one if
        you add a reference to the clue lists.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-3-2">4.3.2&nbsp; Answer-length pattern and substitutions</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        An <i>answer-length pattern and substitutions</i> are used to find and process
        answer-length expressions in the document&apos;s clues.  An <i>answer-length
        expression</i> is an optional component of a clue that indicates the length of its
        answer.  If it is present, it must come at the end of a <i>defined clue</i> (ie, a clue
        that is not a reference).  It usually consists of one or more numbers separated by
        punctuation and enclosed in parentheses.  For example, in the clue
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        <span class="clue"><b>5, 23</b>&nbsp; A Malaysian city (5,6)</span> ,
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        the answer-length expression is &quot;(5,6)&quot;.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        An answer-length expression is processed in two stages: a <i>pattern</i> (a <a
        class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular
        expression</a>) is used to search for an answer-length expression in the text of a
        defined clue, then a list of <i>substitutions</i> is applied to any text that matches
        the pattern.  The substitutions, whose target can be either literal text or a regular
        expression, are intended to remove numbers that don&apos;t contribute to the answer
        length (eg, the 2 in &quot;(9, 2 words)&quot;).  After any substitutions are applied,
        numbers are extracted from the resulting text and added together to give the answer
        length.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A document&apos;s default answer-length pattern should be suitable in many cases.  It
        matches a pair of parentheses, <code>(</code> (U+0028) and <code>)</code> (U+0029), at
        the end of a clue, with a decimal digit immediately after the opening parenthesis and
        zero or more characters, excluding a <code>(</code>, between the digit and the closing
        parenthesis; for example, &quot;(6)&quot;, &quot;(3,7)&quot;, &quot;(10-4)&quot; or
        &quot;(12, two words)&quot;.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If the clues of a crossword don&apos;t have answer-length expressions, is is recommended
        that you specify an empty answer-length pattern to avoid the possibility that part of a
        clue will be interpreted as the answer length.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-3-3">4.3.3&nbsp; Line-break sequence</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>line-break sequence</i> (usually referred to as a line break) is used in a <a
        href="#section4-4">prologue or epilogue</a> to start a new line without starting a new
        paragraph.  Its default value is specified by the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-textSection-lineBreak">textSection.lineBreak</a> configuration property, which
        itself defaults to <code>$$</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A line-break sequence is stored with a document only if there is at least one line break
        in the document&apos;s prologue or epilogue.  If you edit the prologue or epilogue of a
        crossword document that was created by someone else, be aware that the document&apos;s
        line-break sequence might be different from the default value.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-4">4.4&nbsp; Text sections</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        A crossword document may have three text sections: a <i>title</i>, a <i>prologue</i> and
        an <i>epilogue</i>.  The title and prologue are displayed above the grid; the epilogue
        is displayed below the grid and clues.  (In the UK, the text above a grid is usually
        called a <i>preamble</i>, but the word does not have a counterpart that means &quot;text
        that comes after&quot;, so <i>prologue</i> and <i>epilogue</i> were chosen instead.)
        The title is a single line of text whereas the prologue and epilogue may consists of
        multiple lines of text divided into paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The prologue and epilogue support some basic text styles: bold, italic, superscript,
        subscript, underline and strikethrough.  When a crossword document is exported as HTML,
        each paragraph of a prologue or epilogue has its own <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        You can edit the text sections with the <a class="command" href="#section8-2-5">Edit
        &gt; Edit text sections</a> command.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-5">4.5&nbsp; Grid entries</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        Any entries that you make in the grid of a crossword will be saved with the crossword
        document, allowing you to solve a crossword over several sessions.  If you want to
        restore the crossword to its original state after you&apos;ve completed it, you can
        clear all the grid entries with the <a class="command" href="#section8-2-12">Edit &gt;
        Clear all grid entries</a> command.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If a crossword has a full set of grid entries, it is said to be <i>complete</i>, and the
        word &quot;Complete&quot; will be displayed in the <a href="#section5-1-2">status
        panel</a> of the main window.  When you&apos;ve completed a crossword, you can set the
        document&apos;s <a href="#section4-6">solution</a> to the grid entries with the <a
        class="command" href="#section8-4-3">Solution &gt; Set solution to current entries</a>
        command.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section4-6">4.6&nbsp; Solution</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The solution is the set of correct answers to all the clues of a crossword.  A crossword
        document may contain a solution or it may have a <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator">URL</a> reference to
        another document containing a solution; in both cases, the solution may be protected by
        a passphrase.  The passphrase facility is intended for use in crossword competitions.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If a document contains a solution, the word &quot;Solution&quot; will be displayed in
        the <a href="#section5-1-2">status panel</a> of the main window.  The solution is
        encrypted in the XML file of the document using the <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">Salsa20 cipher</a> with either a passphrase
        chosen by the crossword&apos;s author or, if no passphrase was specified, an empty
        passphrase that gives unrestricted access to the solution from within CrosswordEditor.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If a document contains a solution that is protected with a passphrase, you must enter
        the passphrase when you open the document.  If you cannot supply the passphrase, you
        will still be able to open the document but the solution won&apos;t be loaded, and the
        document won&apos;t contain the solution if you subsequently save it.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If a document (called a <i>public document</i>) contains a URL reference to a separate
        solution (in a <i>solution document</i>), the external solution can be loaded from the
        location specified in the public document with the <a class="command"
        href="#section8-4-5">Solution &gt; Load solution</a> command.  If the solution is
        protected with a passphrase, you must enter the passphrase in order to load the
        solution.  CrosswordEditor checks that the external solution belongs to the crossword by
        comparing an <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">authentication
        code</a> in the public document with one in the solution document.  When you create a
        linked pair of public document and solution document, you must ensure that the two
        documents have the same authentication code; a procedure for achieving this is described
        <a href="#section4-6-2">below</a>.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-6-1">4.6.1&nbsp; Publishing a crossword with a solution</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        There are four ways in which a crossword may be published with a solution: the document
        may either contain a solution (<i>internal solution</i>) or a URL reference to a
        separate solution (<i>external solution</i>), and the solution may or may not be
        protected with a passphrase.
      </p>
      <ol class="list">
        <li class="spaced">
          <div><i>Internal solution, no passphrase</i></div>
          <div class="wrap">
            There is unrestricted access to the solution from within CrosswordEditor.  This
            option is unsuitable for competitions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div><i>External solution, no passphrase</i></div>
          <div class="wrap">
            You can control global access to the solution on a remote server by, for example,
            placing it at the specified location after the closing date of a competition.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div><i>Internal solution, passphrase</i></div>
          <div class="wrap">
            The solution is distributed with the crossword document but is accessible only with
            the passphrase.  You could, for example, publish the passphrase after the closing
            date of a competition, obviating the need for the separate solution document in
            option 2.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li class="spaced">
          <div><i>External solution, passphrase</i></div>
          <div class="wrap">
            The solution is accessible only with the passphrase.  This option is a
            belt-and-braces combination of options 2 and 3 for competitions.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="wrap">
        If you use CrosswordEditor to publish a crossword competition, it is recommended that
        you use option 2 if you are able to make a solution document publicly accessible on a
        server, or option 3 otherwise.  If it is available to you, option 4 gives most control
        over access to the solution.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section4-6-2">4.6.2&nbsp; Creating a separate solution document</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        You can use CrosswordEditor to publish a crossword in several ways, as discussed <a
        href="#section4-6-1">above</a>.  If you choose to do so by distributing a crossword
        document that contains a URL reference to a separate solution, you must ensure that the
        two documents have the same authentication code.  One way of achieving this is to create
        the two documents from the same master document by following the procedure described
        below, in which the following terms are used:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">

        <li class="wrap">
          A <i>public document</i> is a document that contains the clues of a crossword and a

      <p class="noBottomMargin wrap">
        A <i>spinner</i> is a graphical component for editing a numerical value.  It consists of
        a text field adjacent to a pair of small buttons.  The value in the text field may be
        edited manually, or it may be incremented and decremented by one of the following
        methods:
      </p>
      <ul class="continuationList">
        <li class="wrap">
          clicking on the small up/down buttons;

          rotating the mouse wheel with the mouse cursor over the spinner when the text field
          has keyboard focus (ie, the caret is displayed in the field).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="wrap">
        Using the last two methods, the amount by which the value is incremented or decremented
        can be modified by holding down the Ctrl, Shift or Ctrl+Shift keys, which correspond to
        increments of 10, 100 and 1000 respectively.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section5-2-2">5.2.2&nbsp; Single-selection list box</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>single-selection list box</i> contains a list from which only one item can be
        selected.  The position of an item in the list can be changed by dragging it up or down
        the list with the left mouse button, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Up or Ctrl+Shift+Down
        when the list box has keyboard focus.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A list box appears in a panel with a set of buttons, some of which issue commands that
        apply to the selected item in the list.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section5-2-3">5.2.3&nbsp; Pathname field</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>pathname field</i> is a text field that is intended to hold the pathname of a file
        or directory.  The browse button (<span class="component">&hellip;</span>) adjacent to
        the field brings up a file-selection dialog whose selection will be displayed in the
        field if the dialog is accepted.  If the field is not empty, its background colour is
        different from when the field is empty.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The pathname in the field may contain <a href="#sectionB">special constructs</a> for
        system properties, environment variables and the user&apos;s home directory.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        You can transfer a file or directory to a pathname field by drag-and-drop or by
        copy-and-paste from a file manager.
      </p>

      <h4 id="section5-2-4">5.2.4&nbsp; Text panel</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        A <i>text panel</i> is a text area that supports multiple lines of text and some basic
        text styles, along with a set of buttons for issuing commands to apply the styles to
        selected text.  The buttons of a text panel are disabled if no text is selected.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Text panels are used for editing the clues, prologue and epilogue of a crossword.  The
        text of a clue is treated as a single, indivisible paragraph whereas the text of a
        prologue and epilogue may be divided into multiple paragraphs, with paragraphs separated
        by one or more empty lines.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        In addition to multiple paragraphs, a prologue and epilogue may contain line breaks,
        which have the effect of starting a new line without starting a new paragraph, like a
        <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element in HTML.  A line break is denoted by a <i>line-break
        sequence</i>, which must come at the end of a line, with no space after it.  The
        line-break sequence of a document can be set with the <a class="command"
        href="#section8-2-6">Edit &gt; Edit indications</a> command.  By default, it is set to
        the value of the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-textSection-lineBreak">textSection.lineBreak</a> configuration property, which
        itself defaults to <code>$$</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Edits made in a text panel may be undone and redone with <span
        class="command">Undo</span> and <span class="command">Redo</span> commands, which can be
        issued from the keyboard (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y respectively) or from a context menu.
      </p>

      <h5 id="section5-2-4-1">5.2.4.1&nbsp; Style markup</h5>
      <p class="wrap">
        Markup is used for styles within the text area.  A sequence of characters to which one
        or more styles is applied is called a <i>span</i>.  Spans may be nested (ie, one span
        may contain another).  A span cannot extend across paragraphs in a prologue or epilogue.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        A span has the form
        <code>{@&lt;<i>keys</i>&gt;&lt;<i>separator</i>&gt;&lt;<i>text</i>&gt;}</code> . The
        prefix <code>{@</code> must be followed immediately by one or more <i>keys</i>:
        lower-case alphabetic characters in the range <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>.  The
        first non-key character after the keys is a separator; it is ignored.  The text of the
        span follows the separator, and the span ends with the suffix <code>}</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The characters <code>{</code> (U+007B), <code>}</code> (U+007D) and <code>\</code>
        (U+005C) are <i>metacharacters</i>; that is, they have a special meaning within the
        text.  If you want the corresponding literal characters, you must <i>escape</i> the
        metacharacters by prefixing <code>\</code> to them: <code>\{</code>, <code>\}</code> or
        <code>\\</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor recognises only the keys in the following table; any others will result
        in an error message.
      </p>
      <table class="basic">
        <tr>

      <p class="wrap">
        The keys <code>h</code> (superscript) and <code>l</code> (subscript) are mutually
        exclusive: they cannot both appear in the same span.

        Here are some examples of style markup:

      <div class="example monospace wrap">

      <div class="example monospace wrap">
        This example includes {@b&nbsp;bold text} and {@bi&nbsp;text that is both bold and
        italic}.
      </div>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <div class="example monospace wrap">
        In this example, some {@b&nbsp;bold text has {@i&nbsp;italic text} within it}.
      </div>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <div class="example monospace wrap">
        To get a literal \{ or \}, prefix a \\ to it.
      </div>
      <p class="wrap">
        A style can be applied to a sequence of characters in a text area by selecting the
        characters and issuing the appropriate command, either by using a button below the text
        area or by a keyboard shortcut from the <i>Command</i> column in the table above.  The
        command will apply style markup to the selected text, taking any paragraph breaks into
        account, but it will not consolidate multiple styles into a single span.

      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor allows you to create a crossword document from an external source (eg, a
        crossword on a web page or in a PDF file), by &quot;capturing&quot; the grid and clues
        of the external crossword.  The capturing process is controlled from the <span
        class="component">Capture crossword</span> dialog, which is displayed in response to the
        <a class="command" href="#section8-3-1">Crossword &gt; Capture crossword</a> command.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The grid of a crossword is captured by processing an image that contains the grid.  The
        image processor assumes that the grid is composed of dark lines &mdash; and, in the case
        of a blocked grid, dark blocks &mdash; on a light background.  The grid may be detected
        within the image automatically, or it may be selected manually if the automatic
        grid-detection algorithm cannot be made to work with a particular grid.  CrosswordEditor
        gets the image from the system clipboard; the way in which you can copy an image
        containing the grid to the clipboard will depend on the source and on the tools
        available on your system.  For example, if the grid is an image in a web page, your web
        browser may have a command that copies an image to the clipboard or a command that saves
        an image as a separate file, which can be loaded into an image viewer and copied to the
        clipboard.  Alternatively, your system might have a means of taking a <a
        class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot">screenshot</a> of the
        window of an application (eg, a web browser or PDF viewer) in which the grid is
        displayed.  (In Windows and in the GNOME desktop environment for Linux, this can be done
        by pressing Alt+PrtSc.)  If CrosswordEditor is unable to process an image of a grid, you
        could try changing the scale of the image by using the zoom facility of your image
        viewer before you take a screenshot.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The clues of a crossword are captured by processing separate lists of across clues and
        down clues.  CrosswordEditor gets each list of clues from the clipboard as plain text;
        the way in which you can copy a list of clues to the clipboard will depend on the source
        and on the tools available on your system.  For example, you could select the text of
        the clues from a web page or PDF document, and copy them to the clipboard with the
        standard Copy command of a browser or PDF viewer.  If the clues that you copy to the
        clipboard are not formatted in a way that is acceptable to CrosswordEditor, you may need
        to paste them into an intermediate document (eg, in a text editor), perhaps edit them,
        then copy them to the clipboard again.

      <p class="wrap">
        The parameters that govern the process of capturing a crossword are controlled from the

        the need to set all the parameters each time you want to capture a crossword, most of
        them can be saved together as a <i>parameter set</i> that can be loaded, edited and
        applied when you next want to capture a similar crossword.

      <p class="wrap">
        At the bottom of the <span class="component">Capture crossword</span> dialog is a status

      <h4 id="section6-1-1">6.1.1&nbsp; The <span class="component">Auto grid detection</span> tab</h4>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <span class="component">Auto grid detection</span> tab controls the parameters that
        apply to the automatic detection of a grid in an image that is imported from the system
        clipboard with the dialog&apos;s <span class="command">Get grid</span> command.  The
        simple grid-detection algorithm looks for sets of four or more horizontal and vertical
        lines that occupy the same region of the image, and it chooses the largest such region
        by area.  You are expected to tune the parameters of the algorithm so that it can
        distinguish a grid from other sets of horizontal and vertical lines in the image.  Some
        trial and error may be required to set the parameters for crosswords from a particular
        source.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The algorithm detects a grid line (more properly, a line segment) when it encounters a
        sequence of &quot;dark&quot; pixels: pixels whose brightness lies below the value
        specified by the <span class="component">Brightness threshold</span> spinner.  To allow
        for lines that are more than one pixel wide, adjacent lines of dark pixels are treated
        as a single line.  A pixel&apos;s brightness can vary from 0 (black) to 100 (white), and
        the brightness threshold for grid lines can vary between 1 and 99.  A grid with light
        grey lines, for example, would a need a fairly high brightness threshold.  Grid lines
        must be continuous, so that, for example, lines that have shadows to make them appear
        ridged or grooved would be problematic if orthogonal lines intersected in a way that
        made one or both lines discontinuous for all brightness thresholds.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <span class="component">Minimum length</span> spinner specifies the minimum length
        (in pixels) of a grid line.  It could be used, for example, to distinguish the grid of
        interest from a small grid containing the solution to a previous puzzle.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <span class="component">Minimum separation</span> spinner specifies the minimum
        distance (in pixels) between successive grid lines of the same orientation.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The <span class="component">Endpoint tolerance</span> spinner specifies the amount (in
        pixels) by which the endpoint of a line can vary and still be considered to belong to a
        set of grid lines.  It is, in effect, the width of a border around the grid that the
        endpoints of all grid lines must lie within.

      <p class="tocLink">
        [ <a href="#toc">Table of contents</a> ]
      </p>

      <p class="wrap">
        CrosswordEditor does not have the ability to print crossword documents: if you want to
        print a crossword, you will need to export the document as an HTML file and print the
        file from a web browser.  Exported HTML files can also be used as a means of
        distributing crosswords created with CrosswordEditor in a widely accessible &mdash;
        although non-interactive &mdash; form.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        An HTML file is exported with the <a class="command" href="#section8-1-8">File &gt;
        Export HTML file</a> command.  Most of the parameters that apply to an exported HTML
        file are configuration properties that can be set in the <a href="#section8-6-3-g">HTML
        tab</a> of the <span class="component">Preferences</span> dialog.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        An exported HTML file may require one or two auxiliary files: an external stylesheet
        and, if a crossword has a blocked grid, a block-image file.  These auxiliary files are
        described below.  Both kinds of auxiliary file are specific to the size of the grid
        cell: if the same crossword is exported with different cell sizes, it will need
        different auxiliary files.  Auxiliary files are shared by all the exported HTML files in
        a directory that have the same cell size, while the size-specific names of auxiliary
        files allow crosswords with different cell sizes to coexist in the same directory.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Exported HTML files conform to the <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML 1.1</a> specification.  Because they
        are XML files, they can be transformed by <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> processors.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section7-1">7.1&nbsp; Stylesheet</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        Content and presentation are clearly separated in an exported HTML document.
        Presentation is controlled by a <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> stylesheet, which
        may be either internal (within a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element of the HTML file) or
        external (in a separate CSS file).  An external stylesheet can be shared by a set of
        similar crosswords, whereas an internal stylesheet reduces the number of auxiliary
        files, allowing the HTML file of a barred grid to be self-contained.  (The HTML file of
        a blocked grid cannot be self-contained because it requires an auxiliary file for the
        block image.)
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The stylesheet for a blocked grid is different from that for a barred grid.  The
        stylesheets for both kinds of grid have configurable content such as cell size, font and
        grid colour.  If you have some knowledge of CSS, you can customise the appearance of the
        exported crossword by editing the stylesheet.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        If the stylesheet is in a separate CSS file, the HTML file expects to find it in a
        directory named <code>style</code>.  The CSS file may be created along with the HTML
        file, or the HTML file can use an existing CSS file.  The name of the CSS file is
        size-specific; it has the form
        <code>crossword&#x2011;&lt;<i>separator</i>&gt;&#x2011;&lt;<i>size</i>&gt;.png</code>,
        where &lt;<i>separator</i>&gt; is either <code>block</code> or <code>bar</code> and
        &lt;<i>size</i>&gt; is the size of a cell in pixels.
      </p>

      <h3 id="section7-2">7.2&nbsp; Block image</h3>

      <p class="wrap">
        The exported HTML file for a crossword with a blocked grid requires a separate image
        file for the block.  The block-image file is intended primarily to allow a crossword to
        be printed economically by reducing the amount of ink or toner that is required to print
        a block.  A block image may be a square of solid colour or it may be composed from
        diagonal hatching &mdash; a set of parallel diagonal lines of the same colour.  The
        block image is always used when printing an exported HTML file, but an HTML file may use
        either the block image or a solid block of the same colour as the grid when it is
        displayed on a screen, depending on the value of the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-html-blockImage-printOnly">html.blockImage.printOnly</a> configuration
        property.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The HTML file expects to find the block-image file in a directory named
        <code>images</code>.  The block-image file may be created along with the HTML file, or
        the HTML file can use an existing image file.  The name of the image file is
        size-specific; it has the form <code>block&#x2011;&lt;<i>size</i>&gt;.png</code>, where
        &lt;<i>size</i>&gt; is the size of a cell in pixels.

          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>).  If you choose
          an internal stylesheet, the style information for the HTML file will be contained
          within the file, which has the advantage that there is no auxiliary stylesheet.  The
          <span class="configProperty">html.stylesheetKind</span> configuration property is set

        </li>
        <li class="spaced wrap">
          The <span class="component">Cell size</span> spinner specifies the size (in pixels) of

        auxiliary files.  A warning will be displayed if the selected file already exists, but
        existing auxiliary files will be overwritten without warning.

      <p class="wrap">
        After an HTML file has been written, a dialog is displayed in which you are asked

        operating-system command specified by the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-html-viewerCommand">html.viewerCommand</a> configuration property will be
        executed.  The command will typically open the HTML file in a web browser.  (The

        The <span class="command">Manage file association</span> command provides, on Windows, a

        files with the <a class="configProperty" href="#cp-file-filenameSuffix">filename
        suffix</a> of crossword documents.  A file association will allow you, for example, to
        open a crossword document in CrosswordEditor by double-clicking on its filename in File
        Explorer.  If CrosswordEditor is already running, the document will be opened in it;
        otherwise, the document will be opened in a new instance of CrosswordEditor.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The command creates a file association by modifying entries in the <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry">Windows Registry</a>, which it
        does by generating and executing a <a class="external"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">Windows PowerShell</a> script.
        You may execute the script automatically after it is generated, or you can create a
        script file that you can use outside CrosswordEditor.  In order to run the script, you
        must have PowerShell 2.0 or later installed on your system.
      </p>

        The command brings up a dialog box that controls the content of the PowerShell script

        which you can select the action that you want to perform: <i>Add</i> creates a new file
        association or modifies an existing one; <i>Remove</i> removes a file association that
        was created with the <i>Add</i> option.  (If you add a file association, you will
        probably want to remove it before you change the <a class="configProperty"
        href="#cp-file-filenameSuffix">filename suffix</a>.) The same script is used for both
        adding and removing a file association; the difference in behaviour is achieved by
        adding a switch (the argument <code>-remove</code>) to the command line when the script
        is used to remove a file association.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        Below the <span class="component">Action</span> drop-down list are fields in which you
        specify the locations of three files that are required to create the file association.
        The fields are disabled if the selected action is <i>Remove</i> because the locations of
        the files aren&apos;t required when removing a file association, but the content of the
        fields is always included in the script in case you want to retain a single script for
        dual purposes.
      </p>
      <p class="wrap">
        The pathnames of the three files may contain <a href="#sectionB">special constructs</a>
        for system properties and environment variables.  If a specified system property exists,
        the construct that denotes the property key (eg, <code>${java.home}</code>) will be
        replaced by the property value.  Environment variables, however, will not be expanded
        but will be converted to their Windows form (eg, <code>${JAVA_HOME}</code> will be
        converted to <code>%JAVA_HOME%</code>) before they are included in the script.  The
        environment variables will be set in Registry values and expanded by the operating
        system.

      <p class="wrap">
        Environment variables of the form <code>%<i>name</i>%</code> may appear in a pathname,

      <p class="wrap">
        The <span class="component">Script life cycle</span> drop-down list controls what

        system&apos;s temporary directory, which is typically <code>AppData\Local\Temp</code>
        within the user&apos;s home directory.  The subdirectory has the prefix
        <code>crosswordEditor_</code> , and the full pathname is displayed when the script file

        after execution, according to selection from the <span class="component">Script life
