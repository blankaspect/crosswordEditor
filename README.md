#### Consolidation of codebase, 2023-08-12

Previously, packages that were shared between Blank Aspect projects resided in a separate `common` repository.  The
common code that is used by this project has now been moved into this project, and the `common` repo has been deleted.

----

The Kotlin-DSL-based Gradle build script extends the `compileJava` and `jar` tasks of the `java` plug-in and defines two
tasks for launching the application:
* `runMain` for use after `compileJava`, and
* `runJar` for use after `jar`.
